  caveats <<~EOS
    BattSafe requires a privileged helper to control charging via SMC.
    On first launch, you will be prompted to install the helper tool.

    The helper requires root privileges to read/write SMC keys.
    You may need to grant accessibility permissions in:
      System Settings > Privacy & Security

    If macOS blocks the app (Gatekeeper), reinstall with:
      brew reinstall --cask --no-quarantine battsafe
